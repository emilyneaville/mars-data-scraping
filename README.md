# Web scraping and data analysis project
---
For this project, I will be scraping data from the [Mars News website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html). I want to know latest Mars news by retrieving the title and summary text from the news articles on the website. Additionally, I would like to do some of my own analysis of the [weather](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) on Mars using the table that they provide on the website.
